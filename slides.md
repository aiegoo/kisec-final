# Presence Before and After
Identity is not a login â€” it's a shadow that moves with the user

Note:
We often ask who is trying to access the system â€” but rarely when, from where, and in what state. Identity doesn't appear at login; it lingers in the environment before the user speaks. This is a prelude â€” where presence is felt, not yet proven. A ripple in the fabric of the system.

---

# Environment
The quiet context: IP, hardware, entropy â€” all whisper who you are

Note:
The machine doesn't care about names. It notices voltages, entropy, keystroke rhythms, IPs that drift with the wind. These are the silent fingerprints of our presence. Trust isn't just about secrets â€” it's about consistency in context.

---

# Forms Nowhere, Now Everywhere
Authentication without asking â€” the body speaks before the mouth

Note:
The old model asked us to prove ourselves â€” but now, the proof is already here. Location speaks, device speaks, behavior speaks. The system reads the room before we enter it. Authentication becomes ambient, invisible, continuous.

---

# Signals
A capsule signed by reality, decoded by trust

Note:
All these signals â€” the capsule â€” are bundled into a signed whisper. The system listens not to what we say, but to what we are. It's the rhythm of our typing, the signature of our WiFi, the pattern of our movements through cyberspace.

---

# Superposition of Presence
You exist, and don't â€” until the system observes your trace

Note:
In quantum mechanics, particles don't have states until observed. Our system borrows this metaphor: Until we unwrap the capsule, the user is both present and not. Observation â€” verification â€” collapses uncertainty into trust.

---

# Trust Begins Where the Wire Ends
No perimeter, no gateway â€” only confidence in the origin of motion

Note:
Perimeters have dissolved. There are no more walls, only waves. Trust must now travel with the entity. Not at the door, but at every interface. And that trust is built â€” not with secrets â€” but with context, with consistency, with time.

# Security Assessment Results
<!-- .slide: data-background-color="#2c3e50" -->

## Key Findings

- **Vulnerabilities Detected**: 15 Critical, 32 High Priority
- **Malware Artifacts**: Mumblehard Miner, BPFDoor Rootkit
- **Compromised Systems**: 3 Endpoints, 1 Server
- **Response Time**: 4.2 hours average detection to containment

Note:
Our comprehensive security assessment revealed several critical vulnerabilities that required immediate attention. The malware analysis uncovered sophisticated threats that had been operating undetected.
