        <section data-notes="We often ask who is trying to access the system — but rarely when, from where, and in what state. Identity doesn’t appear at login; it lingers in the environment before the user speaks. This is a prelude — where presence is felt, not yet proven. A ripple in the fabric of the system.">
          <h2>Presence Before and After</h2>
          <p>Identity is not a login — it's a shadow that moves with the user</p>
        </section>
        <section data-notes="The machine doesn’t care about names. It notices voltages, entropy, keystroke rhythms, IPs that drift with the wind. These are the silent fingerprints of our presence. Trust isn’t just about secrets — it’s about consistency in context.">
          <h2>Environment</h2>
          <p>The quiet context: IP, hardware, entropy — all whisper who you are</p>
        </section>
        <section data-notes="The old model asked us to prove ourselves — here’s a password, here’s a key. But now, the proof is already here. It’s in how the device boots, in the curve of system entropy, in how quickly your cursor moves. Authentication is ambient — like oxygen. We don't see it. But it sees us.">
          <h2>Forms Nowhere, Now Everywhere</h2>
          <p>Authentication without asking — the body speaks before the mouth</p>
        </section>
        <section data-notes="All these signals — the capsule — are bundled into a signed whisper. The system listens. Not with eyes, but with math. This is not surveillance. This is presence affirmation. You are here, and this message — this capsule — could only come from you.">
          <h2>Signals</h2>
          <p>A capsule signed by reality, decoded by trust</p>
        </section>
        <section data-notes="In quantum mechanics, particles don’t have states until observed. Our system borrows this metaphor: Until we unwrap the capsule, the user is both present and not. Observation — verification — collapses uncertainty into trust.">
          <h2>Superposition of Presence: Pre-Auth in Quantum Metaphor</h2>
          <p>You exist, and don’t — until the system observes your trace</p>
        </section>
        <section data-notes="Perimeters have dissolved. There are no more walls, only waves. Trust must now travel with the entity. Not at the door, but at every interface. And that trust is built — not with secrets — but with context, with consistency, with time.">
          <h2>Trust Begins Where the Wire Ends</h2>
          <p>No perimeter, no gateway — only confidence in the origin of motion</p>
